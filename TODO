- Import/export adapters should be syberia resources like everything else.
- skip / copy in import and export should be deprecated and just an R adapter.
- If import  or export is just a character, it should create a
  chain of adapters as defined by the syberia_config file. For export,
  a character means we should just use the top of the adapter chain
  (usually file). If the stage is left completely blank, the default
  should be the model version which will then recursively use the just
  mentioned default (so if you do something really clever like define a
  *custom* import/export adapter, which is capable of understanding your
  model version, you will never again have to write import or export)
- syberia_init function for creating a syberia project.
- potentially obsolete the syberia_config file. The root of the syberia
  projects should just be defined by the .syberia directory (and maybe
  we can even get rid of that)
- for model stage, maybe we should change the convention to:
  model = list(gbm = list(...), logreg = list(...))
  so that it follows similar conventions.
- overload the source function to check if the file is a syberia model.
  If it is, run it instead!

Stagerunner:

- Default run stage for a remembering stageRunner should be from the *last*
unfinished stage. DUH! How simple...

Bigger items:

- syberiaTutorial package for an interactive build-up tutorial of Syberia
- testthatsomemore should have file system testing support
